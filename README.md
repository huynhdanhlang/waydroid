# Waydroid

Waydroid uses a container-based approach to boot a full Android system on a
regular GNU/Linux system.

## Overview

Waydroid uses Linux namespaces (user, pid, uts, net, mount, ipc) to run a
full Android system in a container and provide Android applications on
any GNU/Linux-based platform.

The Android system inside the container has direct access to any needed hardware.

The Android runtime environment ships with a minimal customized Android system
image based on [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/). The image is currently based
on Android 13.

## Install

See install instructions [here](https://docs.waydro.id/usage/install-on-desktops)

For the tested CachyOS Android 16 and TFT setup in this fork, run
`bash patches/android16/setup.sh` from the checkout. It also works on a fresh
CachyOS x86_64 Wayland desktop. See the [one-command setup and compatibility
notes](patches/android16/README.md#one-command-setup-on-cachyos).
